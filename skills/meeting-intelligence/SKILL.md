# Meeting Intelligence

Prepares you for meetings by gathering context from Notion, enriching it with research, and creating comprehensive meeting materials. Generates both an internal pre-read for attendees and an external-facing agenda for the meeting itself.

## Quick Start

When asked to prep for a meeting:

1. **Gather Notion context**: Search for related pages
2. **Fetch details**: Read relevant content
3. **Enrich with research**: Add context, industry insights, or best practices
4. **Create internal pre-read**: Background context document for attendees
5. **Create external agenda**: Meeting agenda shared with all participants
6. **Link resources**: Connect both docs to related projects and each other

## Meeting Prep Workflow

### Step 1: Understand meeting context

Collect meeting details:
- Meeting topic/title
- Attendees (internal team + external participants)
- Meeting purpose (decision, brainstorm, status update, customer demo)
- Meeting type (internal only vs. external participants)
- Related project/initiative
- Specific topics to cover

### Step 2: Search for Notion context

Find relevant content:
- Project pages related to meeting topic
- Previous meeting notes
- Specifications or design docs
- Related tasks or issues
- Recent updates or reports
- Customer/partner information (if applicable)

### Step 3: Enrich with research

Beyond Notion content, add value through:

**For technical meetings**: Explain complex concepts, summarize best practices, provide competitive context

**For customer meetings**: Research company background (public info), industry trends, common pain points

**For decision meetings**: Decision-making frameworks, risk analysis patterns, trade-off considerations

### Step 4: Create internal pre-read

Title: "[Meeting Topic] - Pre-Read (Internal)"

Content structure:
- **Meeting Overview**: Date, time, attendees, purpose
- **Background Context**: What this is about, why it matters, links to Notion pages
- **Current Status**: Where we are now, recent updates, key metrics
- **Context & Insights**: Industry context, relevant considerations
- **Key Discussion Points**: Topics needing airtime, open questions, decisions required
- **What We Need**: Expected outcomes, decisions to make, next steps to define

Audience: Internal attendees only

### Step 5: Create external agenda

Title: "[Meeting Topic] - Agenda"

Content structure:
- **Meeting Details**: Date, time, attendees
- **Objective**: Clear meeting goal (1-2 sentences)
- **Agenda Items** (with time allocations)
- **Discussion Topics**: Key items to cover, questions to answer
- **Decisions Needed**: Clear decision points
- **Action Items**: (To be filled during meeting)
- **Related Resources**: Links to relevant pages, link to pre-read

Audience: All participants (internal + external)

### Step 6: Link documents

1. Link pre-read to agenda with mention
2. Link both to project page's "Meetings" section
3. Cross-reference for easy navigation

## Agenda Types by Meeting Purpose

| Purpose | Structure |
|---------|-----------|
| **Decision** | Details → Objective → Options (Pros/Cons) → Recommendation → Discussion → Decision → Actions |
| **Status Update** | Details → Status → Progress → Upcoming → Blockers → Discussion → Actions |
| **Customer/External** | Details → Objective → Agenda Items (timed) → Discussion → Next Steps |
| **Brainstorming** | Details → Objective → Constraints → Ideas → Discussion → Next Steps |

## Best Practices

1. **Create both documents** for important meetings
2. **Distinguish sources**: Label what's from Notion vs. research
3. **Start with search**: Cast wide net, then narrow
4. **Keep pre-read concise**: 2-3 pages maximum
5. **Professional external docs**: Agenda should be polished and focused
6. **Share early**: Give attendees 24hr+ to review important meetings
7. **Update post-meeting**: Capture decisions and actions in agenda

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Too much context | Split into pre-read (comprehensive) and agenda (focused) |
| Can't find relevant pages | Broaden search, try different terms, ask user for URLs |
| Meeting purpose unclear | Ask user to clarify before proceeding |
| External meeting - no internal context | Create simpler structure, skip or minimize pre-read |

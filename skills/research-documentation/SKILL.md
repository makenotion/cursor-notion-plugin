# Research & Documentation

Enables comprehensive research workflows: search for information across your Notion workspace, fetch and analyze relevant pages, synthesize findings, and create well-structured documentation.

## Quick Start

When asked to research and document a topic:

1. **Search for relevant content**: Use Notion search to find pages
2. **Fetch detailed information**: Read full page content
3. **Synthesize findings**: Analyze and combine information from multiple sources
4. **Create structured output**: Write documentation to Notion

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Search for relevant information

- Search with the research topic
- Filter by teamspace if scope is known
- Review search results to identify most relevant pages

### Step 2: Fetch page content

- Fetch each relevant page URL
- Collect content from all relevant sources
- Note key findings, quotes, and data points

### Step 3: Synthesize findings

Analyze the collected information:
- Identify key themes and patterns
- Connect related concepts across sources
- Note gaps or conflicting information
- Organize findings logically

### Step 4: Create structured documentation

Structure output with:
- Clear title and executive summary
- Well-organized sections with headings
- Citations linking back to source pages
- Actionable conclusions or next steps

## Output Formats

Choose the appropriate format based on request:

### Research Summary
- Executive summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Key findings (bullet points)
- Source citations
- Recommended actions

### Comprehensive Report
- Executive summary
- Background/context
- Methodology
- Detailed findings by topic
- Analysis and implications
- Conclusions
- Appendices with source material

### Quick Brief
- One-page summary
- Top 3-5 key points
- Critical sources
- Next steps

### Comparison Report
- Overview of items compared
- Comparison table/matrix
- Pros and cons for each
- Recommendation with rationale

## Best Practices

1. **Cast a wide net first**: Start with broad searches, then narrow down
2. **Cite sources**: Always link back to source pages using mentions
3. **Verify recency**: Check page last-edited dates for current information
4. **Cross-reference**: Validate findings across multiple sources
5. **Structure clearly**: Use headings, bullets, and formatting for readability

## Page Placement

By default, create research documents as standalone pages. If the user specifies:
- A parent page → create as child page
- A database → add to that database with appropriate properties
- A teamspace → create in that context

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No results found | Try broader search terms or different teamspaces |
| Too many results | Add filters or search within specific pages |
| Can't access page | User may lack permissions, ask them to verify access |
| Information is outdated | Note the last-edited date, flag for user review |

# Knowledge Capture

Transforms conversations, discussions, and insights into structured documentation in your Notion workspace. Captures knowledge from chat context, formats it appropriately, and saves it to the right location with proper organization and linking.

## Quick Start

When asked to save information to Notion:

1. **Extract content**: Identify key information from conversation context
2. **Structure information**: Organize into appropriate documentation format
3. **Determine location**: Use Notion search to find appropriate wiki page/database
4. **Create page**: Use Notion MCP to save content
5. **Make discoverable**: Link from relevant hub pages, add to databases, or update wiki navigation

## Content Types

Choose appropriate structure based on content:

| Type | Structure |
|------|-----------|
| **Concept** | Overview → Definition → Characteristics → Examples → Use Cases → Related |
| **How-To** | Overview → Prerequisites → Steps (numbered) → Verification → Troubleshooting |
| **Decision** | Context → Decision → Rationale → Options Considered → Consequences |
| **FAQ** | Short Answer → Detailed Explanation → Examples → When to Use |
| **Learning** | What Happened → What Went Well → What Didn't → Root Causes → Actions |

## Destination Patterns

**General Wiki**: Standalone page → add to index → tag → link from related pages

**Project Wiki**: Child of project page → link from project overview → tag with project name

**Documentation Database**: Use properties (Title, Type, Category, Tags, Last Updated, Owner)

**Decision Log Database**: Use properties (Decision, Date, Status, Domain, Deciders, Impact)

**FAQ Database**: Use properties (Question, Category, Tags, Last Reviewed, Useful Count)

## Content Extraction

From chat discussions, extract:
- Key points and conclusions
- Resources and references
- Action items
- Q&A pairs

From problem-solving sessions:
- Problem statement
- Approaches tried
- Solution found
- Why it worked
- Future considerations

From knowledge sharing:
- Concept explained
- Examples provided
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls

## Making Content Discoverable

After creating a page, link it so others can find it:

1. **Update hub/index pages**: Add link to wiki table of contents, relevant project page, or category page
2. **If in a database**: Set appropriate tags/categories, set status to "Published"
3. **Update parent page**: Add to project's "Documentation" section or team wiki homepage

## Best Practices

1. **Capture promptly**: Document while context is fresh
2. **Structure consistently**: Use templates for similar content
3. **Link extensively**: Connect related knowledge
4. **Write for discovery**: Use searchable titles and tags
5. **Include context**: Why this matters, when to use
6. **Add examples**: Concrete examples aid understanding
7. **Maintain**: Review and update periodically

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Not sure where to save | Default to general wiki, can move later |
| Content is fragmentary | Group related fragments into cohesive doc |
| Already exists | Search first, update existing if appropriate |
| Too informal | Clean up language while preserving insights |
